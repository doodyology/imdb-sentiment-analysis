# IMDB Sentiment Analysis

MARCH 14, 2020

A personal repo of a binary classification/sentiment analysis task I completed on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. 

The original data is contined in a .ZIP archive due to file size restrictions. Either unzip the archive or use a package like ZipFile to read the CSV from the archive.
